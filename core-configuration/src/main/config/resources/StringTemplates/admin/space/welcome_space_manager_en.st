<h2 class="txtNav"><center>Welcome to spaces and applications management</center></h2>

<p class="accroche">Silverpeas is structured into spaces that contain applications. Each space may also contains sub-spaces.<br/>
$if(communityEnabled)$
Beside the spaces, it is possible to create communities. Those are peculiar spaces that users themselves request to join, rather than having one administrator grants them access.
<br/>
$endif$
A wide range of applications ready to use is offered to meet all your needs : document management, image gallery, blog, surveys, project management...<br/>
As a <b>space(s) manager</b>, you can manage all the spaces you care.</p>
