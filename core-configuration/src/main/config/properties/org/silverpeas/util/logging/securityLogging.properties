# Logger definition.
# Each logger is defined by its unique namespace and by a logging level.
#
# - namespace: identifies uniquely a logger and represents the hierarchical category to which
#              messages are logged with the logger. Each substring before a dot is the namespace
#              of a parent logger.
# - level: defines the minimum level at which will be accepted the logged messages. If not
#          set, the first defined parent logger's level will be then taken into account. Possible
#          value is: ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
#
namespace=silverpeas.core.security
level=WARNING
