#
# In that case, two choices. If the two choices are both defined, only the password expiration time
# is took into account.
#
# For any choices, we indicate the format of the date time supported by the LDAP server:
# - either 'nanoseconds' for a 64-bit value that represents the number of 100-nanosecond intervals
#   that have elapsed since 12:00 A.M. January 1, 1601 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
# - or 'TimeStamp' for a standard LDAP date time representation according to the pattern
#   'yyyyyMMddHHmm[ss][fraction of seconds]X'
#autServer0.LDAPTimeFieldFormat=
#
# In the first choice, the LDAP server supports the password expiration time LDAP attribute. In that
# case indicates here the name of this attribute (if standard: passwordExpirationTime that is in
# the TimeStamp format).
#autServer0.LDAPPwdExpirationTimeFieldName=
#
# In the second one, the computation of the expiration time is delegated to Silverpeas. For doing,
# the LDAP server must support the password change time LDAP attribute whose name must be indicated
# here (if standard: pwdChangedTime that is in the TimeStamp format), and the expiration rules must
# be defined with the properties PwdExpirationReminderDelay and LDAPPwdMaxAge whose values are
# expressed in number of days.
