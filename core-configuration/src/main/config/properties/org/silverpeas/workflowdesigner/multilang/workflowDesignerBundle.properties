Instance Data represents instance's directory.

workflowDesigner.help.forms = Elements store definition of forms; that is a list of fields in a form.

workflowDesigner.help.participants = A participant describes an actor that acts on a workflow instance. \
The element 'participant' is used further on in several contexts to calculate the actual user concerned.

on a workflow instance.

workflowDesigner.help.states = Each element defines a state of a workflow instance.

<li>Entering the consequences of the action using the "Consequence Editor" screen. \
    Each action should have at least one consequence activated unconditionally. \
    If there are more consequences, they should have conditions and they should be placed \
    before the unconditional one, since the order of the consequences is significant.</li>\
<li>Adding labels and descriptions.</li></ul>
