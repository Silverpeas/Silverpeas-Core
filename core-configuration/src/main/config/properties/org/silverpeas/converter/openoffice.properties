# A list of comma-separated port numbers at which the openoffice services will listen. The number of
# ports give the number of openoffice services Silverpeas will spawn to satisfy the ask of document
# conversions.

# The path of the location of the openoffice program. If not set, the default location according to

# The maximum living time of a task in the conversion queue. The task will be removed from the queue
# if the waiting time is longer than this timeout and an OfficeException will be thrown. By default,
# the timeout is set at 30000ms. Here we set it at a double time for complex document.

# The extensions of office documents compatible with the openoffice converter, separated by comma or semi colons.
# If empty, the default compatible documents are defined by MimeTypes.OPEN_OFFICE_MIME_TYPES.
# If the list is prefixed by "(+)" then the mime types behind the given extensions are added to the default one (cf. just above)
# If filled with "deactivated", then no document is compatible.
# IMPORTANT: extensions MUST be specified with a point prefix: ".odp" for example.
# -> Example, limit compatible mime-types to those corresponding to: .docx;.dotx;.odp;.otp
# -> Another example, adding to default compatible mime-types those corresponding to: (+).docx;.dotx;.odp;.otp
# Mime-type detection can be be improved significantly by specifying file paths instead of file extensions.
# By this way, if the file exists the mime-type is guessed directly from the file instead of a
# predefined mime-type mapping (mime_types.properties).
# -> Example, limit compatible mime-types to those corresponding to paths: /home/silverpeas/files/file.odp;/home/silverpeas/files/file.otp
