/**
 * The service aiming at classifying the contents in Silverpeas on the classification plan (named
 * PdC). The classification of a content in Silverpeas consists to position it on the PdC; it is the
 * process to attribute some semantic metadata to the content. The metadata then can be used to find
 * any contents that satisfies a search of information by keywords. As some contents can not to be
 * positioned on the PdC (it is not mandatory), they can be not detected in the search. The
 * classification of a content on the PdC can be done in one of the two ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the contributor can position explicitly the content on the PdC,</li>
 * <li>a predefined classification is used either to classify automatically the content or as a
 * template to classify the content.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A predefined classification on the PdC can be created for a given node in a Silverpeas component
 * instance or for the whole component instance. The predefined classification is a way to
 * facilitate or to impose the classification on the PdC of the contents when they are published. A
 * node in Silverpeas is a way to hierarchically categorize a content. A node can represent for
 * example a topic. A node is part of a hierarchic tree and it can then contain both some contents
 * and some nodes. So, a predefined classification on the PdC associated with a node is set for all
 * the contents in its children nodes. Therefore, if a predefined classification is not found for a
 * given node, then it is seeked back upto the root node (that is the component instance ifself).
