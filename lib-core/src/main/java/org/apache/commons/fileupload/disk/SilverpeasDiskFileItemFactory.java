/**
 * This factory is to replace the one provided by the FileUpload Apache Commons as a workaround of a
 * no yet fixed bug in the Apache library.
 *
 * The DiskFileItemFactory class in FileUpload Apache Commons has a bug when used in conjonction
 * with a tracker of non-long used temporary files (see
 * http://blog.novoj.net/2012/09/19/commons-file-upload-contains-a-severe-memory-leak/ for a
 * description of the bug and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FILEUPLOAD-189 for a look at the
 * bug fix status). This implementation aims to replace the original DiskFileItemFactory class by
 * fixing the bug (in the hope it will be fix in a next release of the FileUpload Apache Commons
 * library).
 *
 * Beside this bug, some default parameters are also set for the particular use of Silverpeas:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the path of the temporary directory in use in Silverpeas,</li>
 * <li>the thresold size above which the uploaded files are temporarly stored in disk.</li>
 * </ul>
