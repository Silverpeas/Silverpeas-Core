/**
 * Provides an API for executing one or several processes that implement <code>SilverpeasProcess</code> @see {@link org.silverpeas.process.SilverpeasProcess}.
 * This API has been created for chaining within a single applicative transaction different processes (processes
 * dealing with database and file systems together for example) and applying global validations (@see {@link org.silverpeas.process.check.Checker})
 * on output (if any) of processes (Quota disk for example).
 * <code>SilverpeasProcess</code> is an interface which has to be implemented by each process (or task in other words)
 * that has to be taken in charge by this API. It offers methods whose the following three :
 * <ul>
 * <li>process : @see {@link org.silverpeas.process.SilverpeasProcess}</li>
 * <li>onSuccessful : @see {@link org.silverpeas.process.SilverpeasProcess}</li>
 * <li>onFailure : @see {@link org.silverpeas.process.SilverpeasProcess}</li>
 * </ul>
 * For now, it exists two types of <code>SilverpeasProcess</code> : @see {@link org.silverpeas.process.ProcessType}
 * The execution of processes is done by the 'execute' methods of <code>ProcessManagement</code> class. (@see {@link org.silverpeas.process.management.ProcessManagement})
 *
 * Two abstractions of <code>SilverpeasProcess</code> interface exists for now.
 * One is oriented on data manipulations such as database registring.
 * An other one is oriented on file system manipulations. This last abstraction implements definitively the 'process' method
 * and offers a new abstract method 'processFile' with FileHandler parameter (@see {@link org.silverpeas.process.io.file.FileHandler}).
 *
 * As concrete API using example, let's taken the photo creation functionnality of the Gallery application.
 * In a first time, create the transactional service which will contain all directives of photo data registering (<code>createPhoto</code> as example).
 * In a second time, create the different Silverpeas processes :
 * <ul>
 * <li>one process to register the photo in database</li>
 * <li>one process to register the photo on file system</li>
 * <li>...</li>
 * <li>one process to handle photo indexes</li>
 * </ul>
 * Be sure all data that have to be persisted in database and all files that have to be saved on file system are handled by Silverpeas processes.
 * Finally, chaining the different processes previously created (@see {@link org.silverpeas.process.util.ProcessList})
 * and executing the resulting chain with services of <code>ProcessManagement</code> @see {@link org.silverpeas.process.management.ProcessManagement}.
