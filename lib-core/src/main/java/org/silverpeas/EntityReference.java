/**
 * A reference to an entity in Silverpeas.
 *
 * An entity is a business object in Silverpeas that is persisted in a data source. Some times,
 * instead of refering a peculiar entity, an object can refer an entity whatever its type; this is
 * why it refers such objects with an <code>EntityReference</code> instance.
 *
 * The type of the entity referred by a such reference is defined by the type of the reference
 * itself; An entity reference must be concrete and its type carries the type of the entity it is
 * upon. For example, you can implement a reference to a user by naming it
 * <code>UserReference<UserDetail></code>.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the entity on which this reference is about.

   * The name is different from the class name of both of the reference itself and of the referred
   * entity, so any class name change shouldn't impact the type name here. The type name is in fact
   * derived from the class name of the entity but by removing all extra technical terms in order to
   * keep only the meaningful name of the business object. For example, for the entity
   * <code>UserDetail</code>, only the term <code>User</code> is kept and then set in upper case.
   * Not all technical terms are detected; for instance, only the following technical terms are
   * taken into account: Silverpeas, Detail, Interface, Silver, Content, Full, and Complete.
   *
   * @return the meaningful name in upper case of the type of the referred entity.
