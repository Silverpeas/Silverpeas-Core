/*
   This class is derived from Sha512Crypt.

   Created: 18 December 2007

   Java Port By: James Ratcliff, falazar@arlut.utexas.edu

   This class implements the new generation, scalable, SHA512-based
   Unix 'crypt' algorithm developed by a group of engineers from Red
   Hat, Sun, IBM, and HP for common use in the Unix and Linux
   /etc/shadow files.

   The Linux glibc library (starting at version 2.7) includes support
   for validating passwords hashed using this algorithm.

   The algorithm itself was released into the Public Domain by Ulrich
   Drepper <drepper@redhat.com>.  A discussion of the rationale and
   development of this algorithm is at

   http://people.redhat.com/drepper/sha-crypt.html

   and the specification and a sample C language implementation is at

   http://people.redhat.com/drepper/SHA-crypt.txt

/**
 * A variation of the SHA-512 algorithm (Secure Hash Algorithm) as used in current Unix systems for

 * <p/>
 * This version uses salting and stretching to perturb the algorithm in different ways, and hence
 * to be less vulnerable to attacks. It computes a base64-encoded digest of 123 characters at
 * maximum from a salt and an unencrypted password; the SHA-512 encrypted password in the digest is
 * fixed at 86 characters.
