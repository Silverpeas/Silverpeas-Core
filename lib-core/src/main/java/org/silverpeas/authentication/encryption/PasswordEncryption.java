/**
 * Encryption of a user password or passphrase by using a cryptographic one-way hash algorithm.
 * <p/>
 * While the message authentication and the integrity checking requires a hash function that matters
 * in speed and in efficiency (a different digest for inputs altered even a little), the hashing of
 * the passwords or passphrases require robustness and future-proof against strong attacks that take
 * advantage of a hardware more and more powerful and of the password's lifetime.
 * <p/>
 * Usually, the hash functions used in the encryption of a password is based on a standard and well
 * known cryptographic algorithm: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc. Unfortunately, these functions don't
 * suit well for encrypting password for the reasons explained above; they suffer of the
 * recognizability and of the speed problems. This is why techniques like the salting (random
 * sequence of bytes which is added to the hash function) and the stretching (iteration of the hash
 * function many times) should be used to address the weakness of these one-way hash functions.
 * (These techniques are usually used by the Unix system in their variations of the above algorithms
 * to encrypt the user passwords.)
 * Another and better solution is to use an adaptive key derivations functions to encrypt the
 * passwords or the passphrases as they generate more entropy in the digest computation.
