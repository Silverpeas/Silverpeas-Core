/**
 * A credential is a set of security-related capabilities for a given user, it contains information
 * used to authenticate him.
 *
 * This credential defines, among the attributes, the password, the login and the domain to which the
 * user belongs. The domain is a repository of users having its own security policy and then its own
 * authentication server. The login is the minimum information used in an authentication; indeed, for
 * some security policies, the login can be a unique security token identifying uniquely a user in
 * Silverpeas, whatever its domain, and that is known only by the user himself. For other security
 * policies, only the login and the domain are required to authenticate the user, like in NTLM
 * negotiation. By default, to open a WEB session with Silverpeas, the user has to authenticate
 * himself by using both his login, his password and the domain to which he belongs.
 *
 * The credential may also contain data that simply enable certain security-related capabilities like,
 * for example, the password change. These capabilities are generally set by the authentication
 * process from the response of the authentication server related to the user domain, once the user
 * is successfully authenticated.
