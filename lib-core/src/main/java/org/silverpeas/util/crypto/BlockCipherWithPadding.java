/**
 * In cryptography, a block cipher is a deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of
 * bits, called blocks, with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a symmetric key. Block
 * ciphers are important elementary components in the design of many cryptographic protocols, and
 * are widely used to implement encryption of bulk data.
 *
 * A block cipher by itself allows encryption only of a single data block of the cipher's block
 * length. For a variable-length message, the data must first be partitioned into separate cipher
 * blocks. In the simplest case, known as the electronic codebook (ECB) mode, a message is first
 * split into separate blocks of the cipher's block size (possibly extending the last block with
 * padding bits), and then each block is encrypted and decrypted independently. However, such a
 * naive method is generally insecure because equal plaintext blocks will always generate equal
 * ciphertext blocks (for the same key), so patterns in the plaintext message become evident in the
 * ciphertext output. To overcome this limitation, several so-called block cipher modes of operation
 * have been designed and specified in national recommendations such as NIST 800-38A and BSI
 * TR-02102 and international standards such as ISO/IEC 10116. The general concept is to use
 * randomization of the plaintext data based on an additional input value, frequently called an
 * initialization vector (IV), to create what is termed probabilistic encryption. In the popular
 * cipher block chaining (CBC) mode, for encryption to be secure the initialization vector passed
 * along with the plaintext message must be a random or pseudo-random value, which is added in an
 * exclusive-or manner to the first plaintext block before it is being encrypted. The resultant
 * ciphertext block is then used as the new initialization vector for the next plaintext block. In
 * the cipher feedback (CFB) mode, which emulates a self-synchronizing stream cipher, the
 * initialization vector is first encrypted and then added to the plaintext block. The output
 * feedback (OFB) mode repeatedly encrypts the initialization vector to create a key stream for the
 * emulation of a synchronous stream cipher. The newer counter (CTR) mode similarly creates a key
 * stream, but has the advantage of only needing unique and not (pseudo-)random values as
 * initialization vectors; the needed randomness is derived internally by using the initialization
 * vector as a block counter and encrypting this counter for each block.
 *
 * Some modes such as the CBC mode only operate on complete plaintext blocks. Simply extending the
 * last block of a message with zero-bits is insufficient since it does not allow a receiver to
 * easily distinguish messages that differ only in the amount of padding bits. More importantly,
 * such a simple solution gives rise to very efficient padding oracle attacks. A suitable padding
 * scheme is therefore needed to extend the last plaintext block to the cipher's block size. While
 * many popular schemes described in standards and in the literature have been shown to be
 * vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, a solution which adds a one-bit and then extends the last
 * block with zero-bits, standardized as "padding method 2" in ISO/IEC 9797-1, has been proven
 * secure against these attacks.
 *
 * This class is the base one of all block ciphers which use a padding scheme to complete the data
 * to encrypt when it is not divisible into blocks of expected size. All the subclasses will use the
 * CBC operation mode with the PKCS#5 padding scheme.
 *
 * The encrypted data computed by this cipher is a combination of both the ciphertext and the
 * initialization vector (IV) used in the encryption. So this block cipher implementation can
 * retrieve both the ciphertext to decrypt and the IV that was used in the encryption and that is
 * required by the decryption. This characteristic is important because the encrypted data cannot
 * therefore be directly decrypted by another implementation of the same algorithm, even it uses the
 * same operation mode and padding scheme, and this implementation cannot anymore to decrypt a
 * ciphertext coming from another implementation. Nevertheless, to facilitate the
 * encryption/decryption of a ciphertext between two implementation of the same cryptographic
 * algorithm, this class provides two methods to combine or to extract the IV and the ciphertext
 * to/from an encrypted data.
