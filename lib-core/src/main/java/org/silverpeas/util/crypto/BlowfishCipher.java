/**
 * Blowfish is a keyed, symmetric block cipher, designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and included in a
 * large number of cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish provides a good encryption rate
 * in software and no effective cryptanalysis of it has been found to date. However, the Advanced
 * Encryption Standard now receives more attention.
 *
 * Blowfish was one of the first secure block ciphers not subject to any patents and therefore
 * freely available for anyone to use. This benefit has contributed to its popularity in
 * cryptographic software.
 *
 * This implementation wraps the Blowfish cipher provided in the Java Cryptography API and it
 * performs the redundant operations in the encryption and in the decryption.
