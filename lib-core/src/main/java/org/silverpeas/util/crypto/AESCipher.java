/**
 * The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data
 * established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. It has
 * been adopted by the U.S. government and is now used worldwide. It supersedes the Data Encryption
 * Standard (DES), which was published in 1977.
 * <p/>
 * AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution-permutation network, and is fast in
 * both software and hardware. Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a Feistel network. AES
 * is a variant of Rijndael which has a fixed block size of 128 bits, and a key size of 128, 192,
 * or 256 bits. By contrast, the Rijndael specification per se is specified with block and key
 * sizes
 * that may be any multiple of 32 bits, both with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation provides the encryption and the decryption of text by using the AES
 * algorithm with which the CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) operation mode is applied. With CBC, a
 * random Initialization Vector (IV) is used in order to produce the ciphertext unique; for a same
 * plain text, a different ciphertext can be computed. The resulting encrypted data is then made up
 * of the ciphertext and of the IV used in the encryption. By this way, a different AES cipher
 * implementation cannot decrypt the encrypted data that was computed by this implementation and it
 * cannot decrypt the ciphertext coming from another AES cipher implementation without having the
 * IV combined with the ciphertext.
 * </p>
 * The cryptographic tasks in this implementation are based upon the AES cipher provided in the
 * Java Cryptography API. It supports both AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256, depending on the the size
 * of the key passed as argument in the encryption and in the decryption functions. In order to use
 * keys of size above of 128 bits, the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength
 * Jurisdiction Policy Files are required. For each of these size of the symmetric key, a given
 * number of repetitions of transformation rounds that convert the plaintext into the ciphertext is
 * performed:
 * <ul>
 * <li>10 cycles of repetition for 128-bit keys (AES-128)</li>
 * <li>12 cycles of repetition for 192-bit keys (AES-192)</li>
 * <li>14 cycles of repetition for 256-bit keys (AES-256)</li>
 * </ul>
 * Any other sizes will raise a CryptoException exception.
