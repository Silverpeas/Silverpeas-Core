/**
 * Provides the different exporters and importers of serializable Silverpeas resources in a specific
 * format (PDF, iCal, JSON, and so on).
 *
 * An exporter is a processor aimed to take a given type of a Silverpeas resource for serializing
 * it in a dedicated format into an output stream.
 * An importer is a processor aimed to take an input stream for deserializing from it a
 * Silverpeas resource.
 * Exporters and importers aren't for data source access purpose. Prefer the use of a dedicated ORM
 * for doing.
 * 
 * Some core exporters and importers are provided for Silverpeas components. To access theses core
 * exporters and importers, an ExporterFactory and an ImporterFactory is provided; they encapsulate
 * the concrete implemenentation of the core exporters and importers, so that their client are
 * protected from implementation change.
 * So, for all new core exporters and importers, please enrich the interface of the ExporterFactory
 * and of the ImporterFactory classes to add an access to the implementation of your new core
 * exporters or importers. (Glance at the ICalExporter exemple to know how to do that).
