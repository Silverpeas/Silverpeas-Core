 * Executor of concurrent encryption tasks for the ContentEncryptionService instances. The

 * executing them for the account of the threads they belong to with the use of a semaphore.
 * </p>
 * This class is to be used only by the ContentEncryptionService instances for their inner
 * operations.
 * </p>
 * The concurrency is done according the following policy: a non-privileged task can be ran
 * concurrently with other non-privileged tasks. When a privileged task has to be executed
 * concurrently, it waits for the completion of other tasks and then it is ran in a privileged mode,
 * that is to say it is the alone to be ran and the others tasks (privileged and non-privileged
 * ones) are blocked until it has finished its work.
