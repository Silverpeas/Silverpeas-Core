/**
 * It is a security service for protecting content from an access in plain data. The service
 * provides the encryption and the decryption of content by using a symmetric-key cryptographic
 * algorithm for which it manages the key.
 * </p>
 * The implementation of this service must be accessible within an IoC container under the name
 * "contentEncryptionService".
 * </p>
 * This service doesn't maintain the knowledge of the contents that were encrypted; it is not of its
 * responsibility. Therefore, when the encryption key is updated, it is the responsibility of the
 * content management services to provide this service the encrypted contents they manage. For
 * doing, it provides them an interface to register a content provider in the form of an
 * {@link EncryptionContentIterator} object. These iterators will be then used directly by the
 * content encryption service to renew their cipher when the key is updated.
 * </p>
 * When the encryption key is updated, all of the encryption and decryption capabilities are then
 * locked. If a call is performed to one of this service's methods, an IllegalStateException is
 * thrown.
