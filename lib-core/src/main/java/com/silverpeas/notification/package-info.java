/**
 * Provides an API for pusblishing and for receiving notifications about some topics. A topic refers
 * the nature of information that will be carried by the notifications; for example, a topic can
 * be related to the actions (add and removal) on the comments over the contents managed in Silverpeas.
 * A notification is a message sent by a publisher over a specific topic. Objects interested by such
 * messages have to subscribe for notifications about this topic; theses are
 * subscribers that will be then informed of the incoming notifications through a callback with the
 * message passed as parameter.
 * 
 * The API can also be used for posting messages to several end-points (one to many user
 * communication for example).
 * The API decouples the client from the specific messaging system (JMS, AMQP, ...) used to provide
 * the notification mechanism, so that the underlying MOM system can be changed without any impact.
 * The implementation of this API is a MOM technology-dependent and it is injected through the
 * IoC container within which the Silverpeas components are deployed.
