/**
 * Defines a scheduling system with which Silverpeas components can schedule jobs at given moments
 * in time and in a periodic way. The scheduling system delegates the actual scheduling tasks to
 * an underlying scheduling backend; it encapsulates the implementation used for scheduling jobs and
 * the way they are scheduled.
 *
 * Provides a <code>Scheduler</code> interface with which components schedules their jobs in time.
 * The <code>Scheduler</code> represents a single entry point to the scheduling system and,
 * whatever the <code>Scheduler</code> object is used, a job registered with one scheduler can be
 * accessed by another one. The only way to get a scheduler is to use a <code>SchedulerFactory</code>
 * instance that is built upon the actual scheduling backend.
