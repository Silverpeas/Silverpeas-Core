/**
 * This job trigger fires a job execution at given moments in time, defined with a Unix cron-like
 * definition.

 * <code>MINUTES HOURS DAY_OF_MONTH MONTH DAY_OF_WEEK</code> with
 * </p>

 * <tr>
 * <th align="left">Field Name</th>
 * <th align="left">Allowed Values</th>

 * </tr>

 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td align="left"><code>HOURS</code></td>
 * <td align="left"><code>0-23</code></td>
 * <td align="left"><code>, - * /</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td align="left"><code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code></td>
 * <td align="left"><code>1-31</code></td>
 * <td align="left"><code>, - * ? /</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td align="left"><code>MONTH</code></td>
 * <td align="left"><code>1-12 or JAN-DEC</code></td>
 * <td align="left"><code>, - * /</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td align="left"><code>DAY_OF_WEEK</code></td>
 * <td align="left"><code>1-7 or SUN-SAT</code></td>
 * <td align="left"><code>, - * ? /</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * The '*' character is used to specify all values. For example, "*" in the minute field means
 * "every minute".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The '?' character is allowed for the DAY_OF_MONTH or DAY_OF_WEEK fields. It is used to specify
 * 'no specific value'. This is useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields
 * as currently specifying both the two fields is not supported.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The '-' character is used to specify ranges. For example "10-12" in the hour field means
 * "the hours 10, 11 and 12".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The ',' character is used to specify additional values. For example "MON,WED,FRI" in the
 * DAY_OF_WEEK field means "the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The '/' character is used to specify increments. For example "0/15" in the seconds field means
 * "the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45". And "5/15" in the seconds field means "the seconds 5, 20, 35,
 * and 50". Specifying '*' before the '/' is equivalent to specifying 0 is the value to start with.
 * Essentially, for each field in the expression, there is a set of numbers that can be turned on or
 * off. For seconds and minutes, the numbers range from 0 to 59. For hours 0 to 23, for days of the
 * month 0 to 31, and for months 1 to 12. The "/" character simply helps you turn on every "nth"
 * value in the given set. Thus "7/6" in the month field only turns on month "7", it does NOT mean
 * every 6th month, please note that subtlety.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Be careful when setting fire times between mid-night and 1:00 AM - "daylight savings" can cause a
 * skip or a repeat depending on whether the time moves back or jumps forward.
 * </p>
