 * A scheduler event represents an event that is generated within the scheduling system and that is

 * <ul>
 * <li>A trigger fires the execution of a job: the scheduling system then runs the job within a
 * dedicated thread;</li>
 * <li>A job terminates abnormally: the job execution throws an exception that is catched by the
 * scheduling system; the failover handler is running.</li>
 * <li>A job terminates correctly: the job termination handler is running.</li>
