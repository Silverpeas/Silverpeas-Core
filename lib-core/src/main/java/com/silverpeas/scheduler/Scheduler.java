/**
 * It is the main interface of a Silverpeas scheduler. It provides the features needed by Silverpeas
 * components to schedule some jobs at given moments in time or at regular time. A Scheduler object
 * should maintain a registry of Job and Trigger instances. Once registered, the scheduler is
 * responsible for executing the jobs when their associated trigger fires (when their scheduled time
 * arrives). A job can be executed in a two ways: by an event listener at trigger firing event
 * reception or by a Job object carrying the operation to run. A listener of scheduler's events can
 * be specified at job registering to handle, for example, the status of the job execution or to
 * perform some non-business operations out of the job. Scheduler instances are produced by a
 * SchedulerFactory that encapsulates the actual backend used to implement the scheduling system.
 * Whatever the instances returned by the factory, they share a single entry point to the scheduling
 * backend so that a job scheduled with an instance can be found with another one.
