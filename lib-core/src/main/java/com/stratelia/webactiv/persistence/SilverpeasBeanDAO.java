/**
 * SilverpeasBeanDAO is the interface to use for instanciable component persistence. To get a
 * SilverpeasBeanDAO instance, use the SilverpeasBeanDAO factory. A SilverpeasBeanDAO instance is
 * linked with a SilverpeasBean specialisation. The code below show you how to build a
 * SilverpeasBeanDAO, enable to create, update... objects for TrainingDetail class. <CODE>
 * // get a dao instance, associated with TrainingDetail bean class
 * SilverpeasBeanDAO dao = SilverpeasBeanDAOFactory.getDAO("com.stratelia.webactiv.training.model.TrainingDetail");
 * </CODE> Once a dao instance is build, it enables you to create, update, remove and list objects
 * from TrainingDetail. TrainingDetail has to be a SilverpeasBean specialisation. (A SilverpeasBean
 * contains a PK). The persistance mechanism is based on your bean properties. In your bean, you
 * need to have getXXX and setXXX methods for each "column" you want to be persistant. For the
 * moment, SilverpeasBeanDAO is able to work with int, String and Date. This list can grow in the
 * near futur.
