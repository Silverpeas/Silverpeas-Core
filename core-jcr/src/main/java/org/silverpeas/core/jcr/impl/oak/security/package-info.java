/**
 * The implementation of the JCR is provided by Apache Jackrabbit Oak. It expects, like any other
 * JCR implementations, the users and the groups of users are managed within the JCR. But those are
 * managed directly by Silverpeas itself. In the case they are managed externally, Oak expects a
 * synchronization of them with the repository, and it is what we don't want here to avoid user
 * management duplication, even for satisfying any specific authentication and authorization
 * process. Nevertheless, custom authentication and authorization mechanisms can be plugged into
 * Oak, but they have to be based upon JAAS and the security system of Silverpeas isn't built upon
 * JAAS. So this package provides the components required by Oak to authenticate and to authorize a
 * user but in bypassing all of this security mechanism in Oak.
