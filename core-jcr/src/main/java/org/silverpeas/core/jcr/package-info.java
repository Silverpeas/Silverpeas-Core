/**
 * <p>
 * The JCR (Java Content Repository) provides a tree-based approach to store data with support of
 * metadata, versioning, and WebDAV access. This package provides the classes that wrap the specific
 * implementation of the JCR for Silverpeas use. All the mechanisms used to put a bridge between the
 * JCR backend and Silverpeas are defined in the subpackages.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.silverpeas.core.jcr.RepositoryProvider} instance aims to provide, with the IoC
 * mechanism, the {@link javax.jcr.Repository} object through which Silverpeas access the JCR. The
 * implementation of the {@link javax.jcr.Repository} is provided by the underlying JCR backend. For
 * doing, the {@link org.silverpeas.core.jcr.RepositoryProvider} instance delegates the getting of such a
 * repository to a {@link javax.jcr.RepositoryFactory} object gotten through the Java Service
 * Provider interface (as specified in the JCR API). This factory has to be defined by the bridge
 * between Silverpeas and a given JCR backend and it must satisfy some settings defined in
 * {@link org.silverpeas.core.jcr.impl.RepositorySettings} object.
