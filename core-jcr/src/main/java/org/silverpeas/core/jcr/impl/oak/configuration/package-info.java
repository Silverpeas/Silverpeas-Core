/**
 * Provides the classes defining the different configuration parameters to create and initialize a
 * JCR in Oak. These classes are serializable and are instantiated when loading the JCR
 * configuration file. They are an alternative way to the OSGi configuration adopted by Oak. Indeed,
 * Oak provides only two ways to create a repository: either programmatically by using builders or
 * by OSGi with a dedicated configuration file. Nevertheless, a non-OSGi application can use the Oak
 * OSGi configuration but this requires to load a lot of dependencies on OSGi and on its
 * implementation which aren't needed by the application itself. So, this package is a way to
 * provide a classic and a conventional way to configure a repository through a configuration file
 * out of an OSGi environment by using transparently the programmatic way with the builders.
