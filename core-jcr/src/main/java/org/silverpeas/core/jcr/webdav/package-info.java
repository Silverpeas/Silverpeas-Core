/**
 * It provides the classes with which the JCR can be accessed through the WebDAV protocol. The
 * WebDAV access to the documents in the JCR is provided by Silverpeas to allow their edition with
 * an office editor supporting the WebDAV protocol. For doing, the WebDAV bridge with the JCR is
 * provided by the JackRabbit WebDAV library, which is JCR implementation agnostic, and customized
 * by Silverpeas to ensure the user behind the WebDAV access has the right to access and to edit the
 * document in the JCR. To allow the edition of a document in the JCR by WebDAV with an external
 * editor, Silverpeas uses the custom web protocol mechanism for which a native program to install
 * in the host of the client is provided by Silverpeas. The WebDAV URL of document sent back to the
 * browser of the user is crafted on this custom protocol so that the browser delegates the opening
 * of the document by WebDAV to the native program on the host of the user. This native program aims
 * to look for an office editor supporting the WebDAV protocol and then to launch it with the
 * correct WebDAV URL of the document.
 * @implNote It depends on the Jackrabbit server library.
