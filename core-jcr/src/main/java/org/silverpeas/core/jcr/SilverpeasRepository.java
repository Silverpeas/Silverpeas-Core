/**
 * Implementation of the {@link Repository} in Silverpeas. The {@link SilverpeasRepository} objects
 * are created by a {@link SilverpeasRepositoryFactory} instance.
 * <p>
 * It is in fact a wrapper of the actual {@link Repository} object used to access the JCR with the
 * goal to wrap the login/logout operations in order to implement a reentrant JCR session. Indeed,
 * in Silverpeas several accesses to the JCR can be performed within a single flow of treatment (and
 * hence a single thread) and these accesses can be asked by independent services. As these services
 * don't know what it was done out of their own scope, they cannot know whether a session has been
 * already opened with the JCR and hence ask for their own use to open a session. In order to avoid
 * inter-blocking and interleaving session, a mechanism of reentrant session is implemented in
 * Silverpeas with the aim to reuse an opened session within the same single thread.
 * <p>
 * So, when a call to a <code>login</code> method is performed, the first thing the method does is
 * to check a session is already opened. In this case, this session is just returned, otherwise a
 * true login is performed driving to the creation and the opening of a new session to the workspace
 * of the repository (in Silverpeas, there is only one workspace).
