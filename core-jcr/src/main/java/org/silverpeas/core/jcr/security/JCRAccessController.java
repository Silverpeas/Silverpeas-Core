/**
 * The access controller aims to check the authenticated user has the rights to access either for
 * modification or for read the items in the JCR. An item can be either a node or a property of a
 * node. An access controller should be created for each authenticated user. This class centralizes
 * the rules applied in Silverpeas to control such access rights or permissions for a given user and
 * for whatever implementation of the JCR behind the scene. It expects the control has already and
 * actually been done by one of the
 * {@link org.silverpeas.core.security.authorization.AccessController}s in Silverpeas before
 * accessing the items in the JCR; this controller applying just a simple control to ensure the
 * correctness of the permissions on the accessed item of the JCR with this peculiar rule for
 * properties: the permissions on a property of a node is granted if and only if they are granted on
 * the node itself, and this for whatever property of the node.
 * <p>
 * In the JCR, the access rights for each user or for each group of users are stored within the JCR
 * itself. So the default control of the accesses in the implementations of the JCR are built with
 * this characteristic in mind. As for the authentication, in order to avoid deduplication of such a
 * control between Silverpeas and the JCR, the access control in the JCR has to be delegated to
 * Silverpeas; hence this class. The Silverpeas wrapper over the implementation of the JCR in use
 * should either extend this class or instantiate it to perform access controls for the
 * underlying JCR implementation.
