/**
 * It represents the repositories taken in charge the persistence of the business entities in
 * Silverpeas in a basic way, that is to say without any of the added features from the new
 * Silverpeas persistence mechanism (creation and update date, ...). Theses entities were already
 * yet here before the new Silverpeas Persistence API and they were managed according to the SQL
 * old school way (J2EE BMP way). The repository is here to manage such entities in order to
 * facilitate the migration from the BMP approach to the new JPA one.
 *
 * The managed entities can be a contribution, a contribution's content or
 * a transverse application bean (user, domain, ...) whose the persistence was managed in the old
 * SQL way.
 *
 * This interface is dedicated to be implemented by abstract repositories that providing each an
 * implementation of the persistence technology used to manage the persistence of the entities
 * in a data source.
 * @param <E> specify the class name of the entity which is handled by the repository entity.
