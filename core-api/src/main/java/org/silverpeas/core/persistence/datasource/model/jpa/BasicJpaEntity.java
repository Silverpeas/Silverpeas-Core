/**
 * This abstract class must be extended by all basic JPA entities that don't fit to the persistence
 * rules of the Silverpeas Persistence API. Usually it means to be used for the migration of
 * entities from the old persistence way (J2EE BMP) to JPA.
 *
 * Please be careful into the child entity classes about the use of @PrePersist and @PreUpdate
 * annotations. In most of cases you don't need to use them, but to override {@link
 * BasicJpaEntity#performBeforePersist} or {@link BasicJpaEntity#performBeforeUpdate} methods
 * without forgetting to invoke the super call.
 * @param <E> the class name of the represented entity.
 * @param <I> the unique identifier class used by the entity to identify it
 * uniquely in the persistence context.
