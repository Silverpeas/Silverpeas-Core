/**
 * An authentication domain of users and groups of users in Silverpeas. Such a domain is actually a
 * directory of users and of groups of users providing its ow authentication server. In Silverpeas,
 * the users and the groups of users can be defined in different directories (LDAP service is a good
 * example of such directories) and each of them has their own authentication server to which the
 * authentication can be delegated by Silverpeas. By reifying this concept, Silverpeas is able to
 * mix in several users sources, both internal and external, to add a new one with less impact, and
 * to take in charge transparently the authentication by delegating it by using a protocol specific
 * to the targeted authentication server.
