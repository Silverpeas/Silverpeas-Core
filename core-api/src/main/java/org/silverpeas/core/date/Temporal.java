 * A temporal object is an object that represents an instant in a time line in Silverpeas. This
 * instant can be a date (day in month in year), a time or a datetime.
 * <p>
 * Date, time, and datetime are different types as they don't have any instances in common, but
 * they are part of the same types class. As Java doesn't support the class type concept from which
 * a polymorphic family of types can be modeled, the temporal class is here introduced by a Java
 * interface with a generic type. Temporal can be then considered as a type generator that satisfies
 * a bound constraint (a fix point).
 * @param <T> A temporal type this class should generate.
 * @deprecated Use the java.time API
