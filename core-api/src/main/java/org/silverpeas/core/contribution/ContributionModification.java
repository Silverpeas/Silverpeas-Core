/**
 * It is a process implied within the modification of a contribution. Usually such process is
 * about the modification of some transverses resources that are used by the contribution being
 * modified such as reminders for example. The process should be invoked only
 * when one or more contributions are modified, not when a component instance is modified with its
 * whole contributions.
 * <p>
 * Each implementation of this interface is invoked by the generic contribution modification
 * process to perform their specific task. The process listens for events about contribution
 * modification and so each more concrete business service has to send such events once the
 * contribution of which they are in charge is modified. Usually, this interface should be
 * implemented by each transverse services in Silverpeas Core.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For each contribution, whatever it is, different kind of transverses resources can be created
 * and managed. When such a contribution is then modified in Silverpeas, it is necessary to clean
 * up also those resources. Nevertheless, both the generic contribution modification process and
 * the contribution itself aren't usually aware of them. It is then the responsibility of the
 * services behind the different kinds of resources to take in charge the freed of the resources
 * related to the contribution being modified. For doing, they have to implement this
 * interface.
