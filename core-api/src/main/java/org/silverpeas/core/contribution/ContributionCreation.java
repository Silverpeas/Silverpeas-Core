/**
 * It is a process implied within the creation of a contribution. Usually such process is
 * about the creation of some transverses resources that are used by the contribution being
 * created such as attachments or PdC classification for example. The process should be invoked only
 * when one or more contributions are created, not when a component instance is created from a
 * template with some predefined contributions.
 * <p>
 * Each implementation of this interface is invoked by the generic contribution creation
 * process to perform their specific task. The process listens for events about contribution
 * creation and so each more concrete business service working on a given type of contribution has
 * to send such events once they created a contribution. Usually, this interface should be
 * implemented by each transverse services in Silverpeas Core.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For each contribution, whatever it is, different kind of transverses resources can be
 * created and managed. When such a contribution is then created in Silverpeas, those additional
 * resources require to be then also created. Nevertheless, both the generic contribution creation
 * process and the contribution itself aren't usually aware of them. It is then the responsibility
 * of the services behind the different kinds of resources to take in charge the creation of the
 * resources related to the contribution that has been created. For doing, they have to implement
 * this interface.
