/**
 * It is a process implied within the move of a contribution between two different locations, each
 * of them being either a node in a component instance or a component instance. Usually such process
 * is about the move of some transverses resources that are used by the contribution being
 * moved such as attachments or comments for example. The process should be invoked only
 * when one or more contributions are moved, not when a component instance is moved from one
 * collaborative space to another one.
 * <p>
 * Each implementation of this interface is invoked by the generic contribution move
 * process to perform their specific task. The process listens for events about contribution
 * move and so each more concrete business service has to send such events once the contribution of
 * which they are in charge is moved. Usually, this interface should be implemented by each
 * transverse services in Silverpeas Core.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For each contribution, whatever it is, different kind of transverses resources can be
 * moved and managed. When such a contribution is then moved in Silverpeas, those additional
 * resources require to be then also moved. Nevertheless, both the generic contribution move
 * process and the contribution itself aren't usually aware of them. It is then the responsibility
 * of the services behind the different kinds of resources to take in charge the move of the
 * resources related to the contribution that has been created. For doing, they have to implement
 * this interface.
