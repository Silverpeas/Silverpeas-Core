/**
 * The Scheduling Engine in Silverpeas provides an API to get either a volatile or a persistent
 * scheduler. The first one is for scheduling volatile jobs in the time, jobs that will be
 * discarded at each VM restarting. The last one is for scheduling persistent jobs, meaning the
 * scheduled jobs are serialized into a persistence context so that they can be restored at each
 * VM restarting. Both are built atop of an existing scheduling system and the Scheduling Engine
 * encapsulates it.
