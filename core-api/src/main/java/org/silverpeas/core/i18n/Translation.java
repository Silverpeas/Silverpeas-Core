/**
 * A translation of a text, a property of a resource supporting the i18n features. Such a bean
 * can be a user's contribution or a contribution's content or a transverse business entity in
 * Silverpeas. All objects that represent a translation of a given i18n or l10n bean
 * must implement either this interface or one of its more-typed children interfaces/classes.
 * <p>
 *   For example, as the <code>Publication</code> is a i18n contribution, it must be able to
 *   return a <code>PublicationTranslation</code> instance for each translation asked in a given
 *   language. Another example, as the PdC's axis is a i18n entity, it must be able to return
 *   a <code>AxisTranslation</code> instance for each translation asked in a given language.
