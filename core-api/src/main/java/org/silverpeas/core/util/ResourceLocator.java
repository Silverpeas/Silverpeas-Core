/**
 * The resource locator gives access to the resource bundles (bundles of localized resources and of
 * settings) that are located into a particular directory, the Silverpeas resources home directory.
 * The mechanism used to access the files containing these resources is wrapped by this class. The
 * resource bundles, according to the type of the resources, are represented by a concrete type
 * implementing the {@code org.silverpeas.core.util.SilverpeasBundle} interface. For instance, two kinds
 * of resources are handled by ResourceLocator: {@code org.silverpeas.core.util.LocalizationBundle} for
 * the localized resources (icons, messages, ...) and {@code org.silverpeas.core.util.SettingBundle} for
 * the configuration parameters.
 * <p>
 * The localization bundles and the settings aren't provided in a classical way (id est by
 * injection point) because they aren't carried into the Silverpeas archive as it should usually be
 * done. Instead, they are located into a peculiar directory in the Silverpeas home directory so
 * that administrators can easily modify them by hand. The access to this directory is handled by
 * this class. If in the future, the mechanism requires to be modified, then this modification will
 * be transparent for the rest of the code.
 * <p>
 * In order to keep stable the memory management with the resource bundles, ResourceLocator loads
 * the resource bundles on the demand and uses a cache to keep them in memory for all the running
 * time of Silverpeas so that they aren't collected by the garbage collector. Nevertheless, the
 * policy on the bundle content loading is delegated to the
 * {@code org.silverpeas.core.util.SilverpeasBundle} concrete types, so that advanced mechanism can be
 * used to keep in memory the content itself with an expiration trigger (policy implemented by
 * the {@code java.util.ResourceBundle} class). To have a glance of the policy adopted by the
 * {@code org.silverpeas.core.util.SilverpeasBundle} concrete types, please read their corresponding
 * documentation.
