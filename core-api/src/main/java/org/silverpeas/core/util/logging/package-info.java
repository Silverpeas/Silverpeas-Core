/**
 * The Silverpeas Logging Engine.
 * <p>
 * The Java ecosystem is rich in logging solutions as it was no standard solution provided by
 * Java until Java 1.5. In order to be agnostic to any logging solutions and to be able to change
 * in the time, Silverpeas has defined its own solution with the goal to wrap any possible logging
 * subsystem and to offer logging capabilities specific to Silverpeas.
 * <p>
 * The Silverpeas Logging Engine is based upon a set of well-defined loggers, each of them mapped
 * to a specific Silverpeas module (a business set of features) that can be a Silverpeas component
 * as well as a Silverpeas Core's engine/API. Each logger is defined by a namespace that defines
 * a dot-separated logger hierarchy and a level that filters the kind of messages to record into
 * the Silverpeas logs. If the level of a logger isn't set explicitly, then its level will be its
 * nearest ancestor with a non-null logging level. It will be the first ancestor with a non-null
 * logging level that will take in charge of the recording of the messages from its child loggers
 * to the logs.
 * <p>
 * Silverpeas defines by configuration at least two logs: one for all traces and another for only
 * errors. For those logs, the Logging Engine provides two handlers/adapters that are set to the
 * Silverpeas root logger, <code>Silverpeas</code>. This mechanism is set up by the Silverpeas
 * installer. It is the responsibility to the logging engine implementation to take care of the
 * handlers/adapters for each logger that have their level set (and hence not inherited).
