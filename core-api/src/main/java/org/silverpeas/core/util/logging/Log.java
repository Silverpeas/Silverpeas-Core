/**
 * An annotation applicable to methods and types for which you wish to trace the invocation of the
 * method(s). Only DI managed bean are taken in charge by the processor of this annotation.
 * <p>
 * With this annotation, for each invocation of a method, by default, one log record will be
 * generated with either a default message or the one specified with this annotation. The default
 * message is generated from the simple class name, the name of the invoked method, and the values
 * of the arguments passed to the method (if any). With the {@link Log#dualRecord()} property you
 * can indicate to write two log records instead of one for each invocation of a method. In this
 * case the first one will be written before the method execution and the second one just after its
 * completion. The last record will have along the message (the default or the specified one) the
 * time spent by the execution of the method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A custom message or a pattern of a custom message can be specified with the {@link Log#message()}
 * property. In the case of a pattern, it has to satisfy the templating rules of a
 * {@link java.text.MessageFormat} pattern. With a pattern, the values of the method parameters can
 * be injected into the resulting message: {0} designates the first parameter, {1} the second one,
 * and so one.
