 * A notifier of an event about a resource in Silverpeas. A notification can be performed either
 * within or off the Silverpeas runtime context. According to the need, the
 * implementation will be different and as such an abstract class is defined for each of these two
 * different notification ways:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code org.silverpeas.core.notification.system.CDIResourceEventNotifier} for a notification within
 *   the runtime context of Silverpeas; this notification is based upon the CDI Event mechanism and
 *   as such it is by default synchronous.</li>
 *   <li>{@code org.silverpeas.core.notification.system.JMSResourceEventNotifier} for a notification off the
 *   runtime context of Silverpeas; it uses a JMS backend and as such it is naturally asynchronous.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
