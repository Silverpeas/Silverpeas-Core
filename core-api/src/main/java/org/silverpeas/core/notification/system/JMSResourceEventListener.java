/**
 * An asynchronous event listener. Asynchronous events are carried by JMS and are collected by this

 * the asynchronous notification between Silverpeas inner components shouldn't use this mechanism.
 * <p>
 * All concrete listeners have just to extend this abstract class and to implement
 * first the {@code org.silverpeas.core.notification.system.JMSResourceEventListener#getResourceEventClass()}
 * method to specify the class of the events to receive and then some of the following methods to
 * transparently receive the events on which they are interested:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code org.silverpeas.core.notification.system.ResourceEventListener#onCreation(ResourceEvent} to
 *   receive events about the creation of a resource,</li>
 *   <li>{@code org.silverpeas.core.notification.system.ResourceEventListener#onUpdate(ResourceEvent} to
 *   receive events about the update of a resource,</li>
 *   <li>{@code org.silverpeas.core.notification.system.ResourceEventListener#onRemoving(ResourceEvent} to
 *   receive events about the removing of a resource,</li>
 *   <li>{@code org.silverpeas.core.notification.system.ResourceEventListener#onDeletion(ResourceEvent} to
 *   receive events about the deletion of a resource,</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *   With JMS, when an exception is thrown, a retry mechanism will replay the event delivery. You
 *   can refine this mechanism by overridden the
 *   {@code org.silverpeas.core.notification.system.JMSResourceEventListener#retryAtFailure()} method; by
 *   default this method returns false, indicating to not to replay the event delivery at exception
 *   raising.
