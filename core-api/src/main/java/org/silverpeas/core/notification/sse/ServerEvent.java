/**
 * An event implying data the server has to push to client without the client requesting
 * Silverpeas. This event is called {@code Server Event}.<br>
 * Three elements compose a server event:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code id}, an identifier that identifies the event</li>
 * <li>{@code name}, the name of the event. It can be taken like the name of a bus. This name
 * is used by client to add listeners. For example, il the name of an event is {@code
 * USER_SESSION} the client (in JavaScript) can listen to by coding
 * <pre>
 *     new EventSource(...).addEventListener('USER_SESSION', function(serverEvent){
