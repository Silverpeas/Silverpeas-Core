/**
 * An event implying data the server has to push to client without the client requesting
 * Silverpeas. This event is called {@code Server Event}.<br/>
 * Three elements compose a server event:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code id}, an identifier that identifies the event</li>
 *   <li>{@code name}, the name of the event. It can be taken like the name of a bus. This name
 *   is used by client to add listeners. For example, il the name of an event is {@code
 *   USER_SESSION} the client (in JavaScript) can listen to by coding
 *   <pre>
 *     new EventSource(...).addEventListener('USER_SESSION', function(serverEvent){

 *     })
 *   </pre>
 *   </li>
