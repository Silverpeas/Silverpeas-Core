 * This event is on a change of the state of a resource in Silverpeas. A such change can be a
 * creation (the resource is spawn to life), an update, a removing, a deletion and so on. A change
 * is then manifested by a transition between two states of the related resource. Hence, the event
 * is characterized by a type that indicates the nature of the change occurring on
 * the resource, and by the state transition of the resource implied by this change. This state
 * transition carries an instance of the resource as it was before the change and an instance of
 * the resource as it is actually.
