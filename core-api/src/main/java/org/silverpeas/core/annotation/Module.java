/**
 * This annotation has to be used to the packages to define at which Silverpeas module the package
 * belongs to.
 * <p>
 * Silverpeas is made up of several modules, each of them defining either a given business model, id
 * est a functional service or an application. A module is uniquely identified by a simple name.
 * Each module in Silverpeas provides a set of interfaces that can be used by others modules to
 * realize their responsibilities; codes in modules shouldn't use the classes in others modules but
 * the interfaces.
 * <p>
 * The annotation can be used by some transverse services to perform some dedicated operations
 * based upon the module a code belongs to. For example, the Silverpeas Logging API uses this
 * annotation to figure out the module a given object or class belongs to.
