/**
 * This annotation is to tag an object as being a web service whose lifecycle is bound to the scope
 * of the HTTP exchange (request/response) between him and the client behind de request.
 *
 * Beans annotated with this annotation are marked to be managed by the underlying IoC container and
 * to be bound to the scope of the HTTP request processing. If the bean declare another
 * life-cycle scope, then the new scope overrides the default one.
 *
 * The annotation is an abstraction above the IoC container used by Silverpeas so that it is can
 * possible to change the IoC container (Spring or CDI for example) by changing the wrapped annnotation
 * to those specific at this IoC implementation without impacting the annotated IoC managed beans.
