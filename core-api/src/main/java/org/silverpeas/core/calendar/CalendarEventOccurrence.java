/**
 * The occurrence of an event in a Silverpeas calendar. It is an instance of an event in the
 * timeline of a calendar; it represents an event starting and ending at a given date or datetime
 * in the calendar.
 *
 * A non-recurrent event is a singleton, meaning that is has only one single instance occurring in
 * the calendar (so the name occurrence). A recurrent event has one or more occurrences in the
 * timeline. It occurs several time in the calendar in a regular way according to its recurrence
 * rule; at each time such an event occurs is represented by an occurrence.
 *
 * By default, the occurrences of an event aren't persisted but they are generated from the period
 * of time at which occurs the event and, if any, from its recurrence rule. If an occurrence of a
 * non-recurrent event is deleted, then the related event is deleted. If an occurrence of a
 * recurrent event is deleted, then an exception is added into the recurrence rule of the event.
 * This operation is done with one of the following methods:
 * {@link #delete()},
 * {@link #deleteSinceMe()}.
 * If an occurrence of a non-recurrent event is modified, then the modification is directly
 * applied to the event itself (as it is a singleton). If an occurrence of a recurrent event is
 * modified, then the modification is applied to the occurrence only and this occurrence is
 * persisted as a modification related to the recurrence rule of the concerned event.
