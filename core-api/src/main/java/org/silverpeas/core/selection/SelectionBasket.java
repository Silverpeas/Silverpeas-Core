/**
 * A basket of a selection of Silverpeas resources. It is specific to each user and lives along the
 * current session of the user; it expires with the session of the user. A resource can be present
 * only one time in the basket whatever its selection context. So putting it again in the basket
 * doesn't add it a second time but update its position in the basket so that it will be the first
 * one to be popped.
 * <p>
 * The basket behaves like an indexed stack of {@link SelectionEntry} instances, each of them
 * related to a given Silverpeas resource selected by the current user. Each entries, and hence each
 * resource, is then indexed by their position in the stack, that is to say by the ordered way they
 * were put into the basket: the first resource put in the basket is at the tail of the stack, the
 * second resource just atop of the first resource, and so on. The last resource is hence at the
 * head of the stack, and therefore it will be the first one to be popped. Because the resources put
 * in the basket are indexed by their position, they can be gotten by their index.
