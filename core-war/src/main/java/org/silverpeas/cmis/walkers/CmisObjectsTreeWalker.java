/**
 * A walker of a CMIS objects tree in which each node and leaf are mapped to a given Silverpeas
 * organizational resource or to a given user contribution. The root of the tree is a virtual
 * container of all the Silverpeas root spaces. The walker provides a functional view to access the
 * CMIS objects but behind de scene it walks across the organizational schema of Silverpeas by using
 * its different services. Because the way to access an object in Silverpeas (and hence to browse
 * the CMIS objects tree) depends on the types of the Silverpeas objects implied in a walk of the
 * CMIS tree, the implementation of the walker is left to more concrete walkers specifically
 * designed to handle a peculiar type of Silverpeas objects. And consequently as each type of
 * Silverpeas objects is mapped to a peculiar type of a CMIS object, those concrete walkers are also
 * dedicated to handle, in their functional view, a peculiar type of CMIS objects.
