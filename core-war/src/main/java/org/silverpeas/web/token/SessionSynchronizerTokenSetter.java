/**
 * A setter of a session token to the new spawned user session. A user session is really created in
 * Silverpeas when a MainSessionController is instanciated and set to the current HTTP session.
 * Nevertheless, this session token is set for each HTTP session created by the underlying web
 * container so that it can be used with some credentials management function (password reseting,
 * new registration, ...) whereas the user isn't authentified; in this last case, the session token
 * is used as an anti-fuzzing token.
 * <p>
 * The aim of the session token is to protect the current user session from attempt of intrusively
 * use of it by anyone other that the user himself.
 * <p>
 * Because the web pages in Silverpeas has a deep use of HTML frames and of page relocation/reload,
 * in order the requests sent by these elements can be correctly taken in charge in the token
 * validation process, a cookie is created and valued with the session token.
