/**
 * A user profile defined in an application component. A user profile is a mix between a role and
 * some privileges. The name of the profile denotes the name of the role. If the application can
 * describe any role it supports, even new ones, Silverpeas does support only a set of predefined
 * roles, all of them represented in the {@link org.silverpeas.core.admin.user.model.SilverpeasRole}
 * enum. To these roles are automatically mapped some privileges which are all hard-coded and based
 * upon access rights conventions in Silverpeas (for example the
 * {@link org.silverpeas.core.admin.user.model.SilverpeasRole#READER} role has read-only access to
 * the contributions). So, when a user profile is defined for an application, a mapping between this
 * profile with one of the predefined user profile in Silverpeas is required; if no mapping is
 * provided, then by default the name of the profile should match the name of a predefined profile.
 * The mapping of profiles are applied between those of the parent space and the instances of the
 * application component; so only a subset of predefined roles in Silverpeas is concerned by the
 * mapping of profiles: see {@link InheritableSpaceRoles} to have a look of them.
