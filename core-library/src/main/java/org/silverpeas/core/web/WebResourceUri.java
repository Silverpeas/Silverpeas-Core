 * URI of the current web resource, that is the web resource being in execution and whose execution

 * to replace the use of {@link UriInfo} as it takes care of the Silverpeas settings in regard to
 * the URL, host and web context definitions and as it is dedicated to compute more easily the URI
 * of the Web entities involved by the incoming HTTP requests.
 * <p>
 * The different properties of such a running web resource URI are explained by an example here.
 * For the following request URI:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code http://localhost:8000/silverpeas/services/toto/kmelia32/content/bidule?p=3&u=10}</pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The base URI is {@code http://localhost:8000/silverpeas/services}</li>
 *   <li>The request URI is {@code http://localhost:8000/silverpeas/services/toto/kmelia32/content/bidule?p=3&u=10}</li>
 *   <li>The absolute web resource path is {@code http://localhost:8000/silverpeas/services/toto/kmelia32}</li>
 *   <li>The web resource path is {@code /silverpeas/services/toto/kmelia32}</li>
 *   <li>The absolute path is {@code http://localhost:8000/silverpeas/services/toto/kmelia32/content/bidule}</li>
 *   <li>The path is {@code /silverpeas/services/toto/kmelia32/content/bidule}</li>
 *   <li>The query parameters are taken from the parsing of {@code ?p=3&u=10}</li>
 *   <li>The path parameters are all nodes in the URI that matches with an parameter in the
 *   @{@link javax.ws.rs.Path} annotations of the web resource</li>
