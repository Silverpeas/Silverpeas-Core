/**
 * A provider of Silverpeas files. This provider aims to provide a single point to simply retrieve
 * files managed in Silverpeas in the form of a {@link SilverpeasFile}
 * instances. The {@link SilverpeasFile} class provides useful methods to
 * manage the files in Silverpeas. Both {@code SilverpeasFileProvider} and {@code SilverpeasFile}
 * classes support a mechanism of pre and post operations processing permitting to hook additional
 * treatments on the files handled in Silverpeas.
 * <p>
 * Unlike the IO Processing API in Silverpeas, it is not dedicated to be used within a
 * transactional file processing; for a such use, please see the
 * {@link FileHandler} class that offers a higher level access to the
 * files managed in Silverpeas. This class is dedicated to provide a low-level and a single and
 * unique point to access the files in Silverpeas with a support for an additional computing in
 * order to hook parallel behaviours on the handled file.
 * <p>
 * The Silverpeas File Provider provides two extensions points to hook additional computations with
 * the file operations. For example, a process can be hooked to resize automatically the images on
 * the demand (see {@link ImageResizingProcessor} for a such example of
 * processors). To hook such processors, they have to implement the
 * {@link SilverpeasFileProcessor} interface.
