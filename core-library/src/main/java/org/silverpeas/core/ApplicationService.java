/**
 * A service providing the transverse operations related to a given Silverpeas application. A
 * Silverpeas application is a component related to the Silverpeas portal that provides features to
 * manage in a given way some types of user contributions and contents.
 * <p>
 * The service gathers the business functionalities the application offers to users or to other
 * components in Silverpeas and it gives access to both the application settings and the
 * application specific l10n translations. In the approach used in Silverpeas,  this service should
 * not be accessed directly by clients but through the business entities that are managed by the
 * instances of the application (in the DDD (Domain Driven Development) way).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some transverse services in Silverpeas Core use this interface to discover and to access the
 * business services of the applications in order to perform some of their centralized tasks. For
 * example, the notification of user about new comments is based on this interface. So, in order to
 * profit of these centralized and transverse functionalities, an application has to provide a
 * specific business service that implements this interface. In order to facilitate the business
 * service discovery, it is recommended to follow the convention in which the service is annotated
 * by the {@code javax.inject.Named} annotation valued with the name of the application (starting
 * in lower case) followed by the term "Service". For example, a service of a Foo application
 * should be annotated by <code>@Named("fooService")</code>.
 * </p>

 * @param <T> The concrete type of the content the component is dedicated to manage.
