# Cron to determine when synchronizations are done
# A cron like string ([*|NUM{,NUM}] [*|NUM{,NUM}] [*|NUM{,NUM}] [*|NUM{,NUM}] [*|NUM{,NUM}])
# The allowed ranges are:
#   minutes (0-59),
#   hours (0-23),
#   days of a month (1-31),
#   months (1-12; starts with 1 for January),
#   day of a week (0-6; starts with 0 for Sunday).
# The cron is read only at startup time. A change in the cron requires to restart Silverpeas.
#
# So the string '* 2 * * *' starts the synchronization every days at 2:00pm
calendar.synchronization.cron = * 2 * * *

# The number of synchronization processors to run in parallel. Each processor take in charge a
# different synchronized calendars. A value of 0 or no value means the number of processors is
# computed by the Silverpeas itself according to the number of available processors in the server.
# This value is read each time the synchronization mechanism is triggered by the cron above; it can
# then be updated by hand at runtime.
calendar.synchronization.processors = 0

# Some ics files could have some data errors such as wrong date format for example.
# By this parameter, it is possible to replace parts of file content by regexp rules.
# Rules are separated by ';' char.
# A rule is defined by the sequence (regexp) to match and the sequence to replace in both separated by "/"
# For example: CREATED:0000/CREATED:1970
# The synchronization process uses also this parameter.
