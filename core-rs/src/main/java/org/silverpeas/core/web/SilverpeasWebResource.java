/**
 * The representation of a resource managed by Silverpeas in the Web. A resource accessible by the
 * Web provides an access to the instances of the resource and defines a set of operations that
 * be performed on those instances. A resource is always identified by an URI by which it can be
 * accessed in the Web; all instances of such a resource are then identified from this URI that is
 * used as the base one for the resource instances and operations.
 * <p>
 * A Web resource represents an entity in Silverpeas that is accessible through the Web. This
 * entity can a be contribution, a contribution's content, or a any business entities used in
 * Silverpeas (like the user profiles for example).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Named as <code>Target</code> in the JAX-RS jargon, as being the endpoint of an URI-based HTTP
 * communication, the Web resource acts in fact, for the Web clients, as a proxy of the entities it
 * is intended to represent and, as such it is uniquely identified by a base URI at which the
 * entities are meant to be exposed on the Web. As a proxy, it plays the role of a translator, as it
 * translates the expected HTTP requests in business methods implying the entity(ies) targeted by
 * the requested URI, and then it translates the answer of those methods in an HTTP response that
 * is sent back to the requester; usually, the response carries a representation of the entity(ies)
 * implying in the treatment according to the negotiated format (specified in MIME).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * So, an entity that is accessible on the Web is then structured in the following way:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The entity itself defining the business operations through which the applications in
 * Silverpeas manage it. This entity has no knowledge of the Web and of how to be interfaced
 * with.</li>
 * <li>The Web resource, proxying the entity for the Web and translating the HTTP-verbs in
 * business operations implying the entity(ies) targeted by the exact requested URI.
 * </li>
 * <li>The entity Web state (aka entity state representation for the Web), ready to be encoded
 * into the negotiated representation format (usually in JSON) and that represents the state of
 * the entity at the time the HTTP request is answered.</li>
 * </ul>
