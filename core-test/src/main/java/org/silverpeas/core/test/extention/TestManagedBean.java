 * tests. The bean is set for each test method invocation so any change performed in a previous test
 * is lost once that test is done. If the bean isn't instantiated, then it should have a default
 * constructor (whatever its visibility) so that the JUnit extension handling the annotation is able
 * to instantiate it.
