/**
 * This annotation is used to indicate that a field or a parameter has to be instantiated and then
 * registered into the bean container used in the test before executing that test. For doing, the
 * bean type must have a default constructor. Once instantiated, if the bean has a
 * {@link javax.annotation.PostConstruct} annotated method, then this method will be invoked.
 * This annotation is for classes for which an instance is preferred to a mock in unit tests.
 * The difference between such beans and those annotated with {@link TestedBean} is that the
 * injection points in the former aren't resolved; indeed, {@link TestManagedBean} annotated beans
 * are considered just like mock but with a true instance (a kind of stub then).
 * <p>
 * Any field annotated with this annotation can be explicitly instantiated, in that case it is that
 * instance that will be registered into the bean container and no
 * {@link javax.annotation.PostConstruct} annotated method will be invoked. If the test class
 * declares several annotated fields having a common type among their ancestor, then the fields
 * will be registered for that type and they could be get by using the
 * {@link org.silverpeas.core.test.TestBeanContainer#getAllBeansByType(Class, Annotation...)}
 * method. In that case, the call of
 * {@link org.silverpeas.core.test.TestBeanContainer#getBeanByType(Class, Annotation...)} method
 * with that type as parameter will throw an exception.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the annotation is applied to a parameter, then a bean of the parameter type is first looking
 * for in the bean container used in the tests. If no such bean is found, then the type is
 * instantiated, the newly created bean is registered into the bean container and finally it is
 * passed as parameter value. By using this annotation with the parameters, you can get any
 * previously registered bean.
