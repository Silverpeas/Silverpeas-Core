    <section name="Introduction">
      <p>The configuration of Silverpeas behind an Apache reverse-proxy is quite straightforward.<br/>
In this example we want to configure a reverse-proxy that is handling SSL and proxyfying a JBoss server on port 80.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="Apache Configuration">
      <p>You should have the following elements in your Apache configuration :
      <source>
ProxyTimeout 600
ProxyRequests off
ProxyPreserveHost on
ProxyPass / http://internal.domain.tld/ keepalive=on
ProxyPassReverse / http://internal.domain.tld/
     </source></p>
      <p>Using the parameter <emp>ProxyPreserveHost</emp> doesn't seem to have any effect on the configuration.<br/>
The parameter <code>keepalive=on</code> is usefull if you have a firewall standing between the Apache server and the JBoss server.<br/>
Notice that we didn't write the SSL configuration. Also the value <code>internal.domain.tld</code> must be replaced by the effective name of your JBoss server that can be resolved.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="Configuring JBoss">
      <p>For JBoss 6 the configuration takes place in the <code>$JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/jbossweb.sar/server.xml</code>, edit this file and change the bold values<br/>
      <source><![CDATA[<Connector URIEncoding="UTF-8" address="${jboss.bind.address}" port="${jboss.web.http.port}" 
        protocol="HTTP/1.1" redirectPort="${jboss.web.https.port}" 
        ]]><b>proxyName="external.domain.tld" proxyPort="443" scheme="https"</b> /&gt;</source></p>
      <p>If Apache is not using SSL, you don't have to define the <code>scheme</code> and <code>proxyPort</code>.<br/>
      The value of <code>external.domain.tld</code> must be replaced by the external resolved name of the Apache server.</p>
    </section>
  </body>
