    <section name="Using the Groovy Script">
      <subsection name="Extract from JBoss Wiki">
        <p>This is based on <a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/SimpleWayToLockUpYourJBossASInstance">this JBoss Wiki Page</a>.</p>
        <p>JBoss 6.x AS is distributed by default as not secured (locked up). If you want to work with locked up version you can try this easy way.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download Groovy script attached to this docment or check the latest version at 
            <a href="https://github.com/pskopek/sec-script">https://github.com/pskopek/sec-script</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Install Groovy:
            <br/>
            <ul>
              <li>Use 
                <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download">http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download</a>
              </li>
              <li>Use your OS favourite method: Fedora: yum install groovy</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Run: groovy securejboss.groovy [JBOSS SERVER HOME]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can specify more then one JBoss Server Home directories. In that case common/deploy content will generate warning because it already is secured.
          check output for possible problems (pay special attention to warnings)
          <br/>
          Note: Always test your installation if it is secured properly.
          The script currently supports JBoss AS 6.1.0.Final and 6.0.0.Final. Check later for JBoss AS 5 and 5.1 support.

      <subsection name="Enabling the usage of Silverpeas stop script">
        <p>The groovy script will lock everything in JBoss even the shutdown process. To enable it again you must follow this porcess :</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Create a JMX user in the configuration file 
            <i>$JBOSS_HOME/server/default/conf/props/jmx-console-users.properties</i> with the following pattern: </p>
            <code>USERNAME=PASSWORD</code>
          </li>
          <li><p>Give hime the 
            <b>HttpInvoker</b> role by adding the following line to the file 
            <i>$JBOSS_HOME/server/default/conf/props/jmx-console-roles.properties</i>: </p>
            <code>USERNAME=HttpInvoker</code>
          </li>
          <li><p>Edit the script according to your OS

            <i>%SILVERPEAS_HOME%\silverpeas_stop_jboss.cmd</i> to pass the USERNAME and the PASSWORD as parameters like this :</p>
            <code>sh shutdown.sh -u goliath -p CharybdeEtScylla -S</code>
