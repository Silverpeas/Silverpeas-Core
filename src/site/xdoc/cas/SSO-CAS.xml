        <b>CAS (Central Authentication Service)</b> is a single sign-on protocol for the web.
        Its purpose is to permit a user to access multiple applications while providing their credentials
        (such as userid and password) only once. It also allows web applications to authenticate users
        without gaining access to a user's security credentials, such as a password.
        The name CAS also refers to a software package that implements this protocol.<br/>
        This document presents the different operations to enable CAS with Silverpeas :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Installing the JDK</li>
        <li>Installing a CAS Server on Tomcat</li>
        <li>Enabling CAS Authentication on Silverpeas</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For the rest of this document <b>ServerA</b> will be the CAS Server, and <b>ServerB</b> will be the Silverpeas Server.
      </p>
      <p>For more informations on CAS you can read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Authentication_Service">Wikipedia's article</a> or go to <a href="http://www.jasig.org/cas">CAS website</a>.</p>
