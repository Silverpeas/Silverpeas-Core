    <section name="JDK">
      <p>
        You will install the latest JDK from SUN: download it from <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp#need">here</a>.<br/>
        It will be used by the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">Apache Tomcat</a> server who will host the CAS server.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Certificates">
      <p>To generate certificates for each server we will use the JDK tool : <i>keytool</i>.<br/>
        The following command will create a keystore in <code>c:/Java/keystore.jks</code> :<br/>
        <fieldset>
          <code>keytool -genkey -keystore c:\Java\keystore.jks -alias tomcat -keypass changeit -keyalg RSA</code>
        </fieldset>
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the password <i>changeit</i>.<br/>
        Enter all the requested informations. Note that you <b>must</b>  enter the name of the server as the '<i>first and last name</i>'.<br/>
        So for the CAS server it should be <b>ServerA</b>.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>Now we need to repeat this operation for ServerB.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="Trusting each others">
      <p>
        Once the server are running, you can use our utility : <a href="https://repository.silverpeas.org/files/CertificateImporter.jar">Certificat Importer</a> to add the certificate to the trustore.
      </p>
      <fieldset>
        <code>java -jar CertificateImporter.jar serverB:8443 changeit c:\Java\keystore.jks</code>
      </fieldset>
      <p>Now we need to repeat this operation for ServerB.</p>
