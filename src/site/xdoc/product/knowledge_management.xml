      <p>SilverpeasTM Knowledge Management is built around 3 components: </p>   
      <ul>
        <li>A directory of Experts</li>
        <li>A notification system</li>
        <li>A knowledge database</li>
      </ul>      
      <p>The components promote the sharing and localization of knowledge, and are directly related to the classification scheme by theme.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Users can use an existing axis to classify their questions.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Users identified as competent experts on themes, receive notifications and can publish their answers.
      </p> 
      <p>
        The knowledge base can be consulted by readers with read rights. Component animators are in charge of closing and moving exchanges.
      </p> 
      <p>
        The knowledge base component allows the FAQ tree structure to be organised by theme.
      </p> 
      <p>
        FAQ can be accessed via the tree structre or the search engine.
      </p> 
      <p>
        The components' settings can be adjusted using a simple administration interface needing only basic IT skills.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Associating components with the Experts directory:
      </p> 
      <p>
        By associating the components with the experts directory, all parts can be associated to a technical expert, with the authorization to contribute and answer questions according to their field of expertise
      </p> 
      <p>
        The Experts directory allows employees to be classified according to their skills, in association with classification plan. Experts are immediately identified and localized.
