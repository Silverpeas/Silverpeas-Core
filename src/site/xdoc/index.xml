      <p>Silverpeas Core is the fondation of the Silverpeas Collaborative Portal. It defines the
        technical architecture and it provides the business services to build collaborative-oriented
        applications.</p>
      <p>The fondation is made up of two layers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A business service layer (atop of a persistence engine) that provides all the objects and
          transversal APIs to manage information, content and social events for applications;</li>
        <li>A Web layer that provides reusable building blocks to facilitate the writing of an integrated Web GUI.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Above this fondation, the main Web Collaborative Portal application is also included in Silverpeas Core.</p>
      <p>Among the business services and APIs, you will find:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a comments engine,</li>
        <li>a social network engine,</li>
        <li>an authentication and authorization engine,</li>
        <li>a content converter engine,</li>
        <li>a publications engine,</li>
        <li>a WYSIWYG content engine,</li>
        <li>and jobs scheduling engine,</li>
        <li>a user notification engine,</li>
        <li>a taxonomy engine,</li>
        <li>and so on.</li>
