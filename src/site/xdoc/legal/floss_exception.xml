    <section name="Silverpeas. Exception  for Free/Libre and Open Source 
        Software-only Applications Using  Silverpeas software (the `FLOSS 
        Exception').">
      <p> 
        <em>Version 1.0, 30 September 2009</em> 
      </p>
      <h2>Exception Intent</h2>
      <p> Our aim is for Free/Libre and Open Source Software 
        ("FLOSS")  applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed 
        Silverpeas software  (the "Program") despite the fact that not all FLOSS
        licenses are  compatible with version 3 of the GNU Affero General 
        Public License (the  "GPL"). 
      </p>
      <h2>Legal Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <p> As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 3.0 of the GPL: </p>
      <p> You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is 
        formed entirely  from the Program and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS 
        Work") licensed  under one or more of the licenses listed below in 
        section 1, as long  as: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and  
          the Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the Derivative 
          Work which are not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably  
          be considered independent and separate works in themselves,
        </li>
        <li>all  identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which 
          are not derived from  the Program, and which can reasonably be 
          considered independent and  separate works in themselves,
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and</li>
          <li>the  object code or executable form of those sections 
            are accompanied by the  complete corresponding machine-readable source 
            code for those sections  on the same medium and under the same FLOSS 
            license as the  corresponding object code or executable forms of those 
            sections, and
          </li>
        </ol>
        <li>any  works which are aggregated with the Program or with
          a Derivative Work  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in 
          accordance with the  GPL, can reasonably be considered independent and 
          separate works in  themselves which are not derivatives of either the 
          Program, a  Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p> If the above conditions  are not met, then the Program may
        only be copied, modified, distributed  or used under the terms and 
        conditions of the GPL or another valid  licensing option from 
        Silverpeas.

      <p>    Due to the many variants of some of the above licenses, we require that  any version follow the 2003 version of the Free Software 
        Foundation's  Free Software Definition (
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>) or version 1.9 of the Open Source Definition by the Open Source Initiative (

      <h2>3. Applicability</h2>
      <p align="left"> This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs 
        that contain a notice  placed by Silverpeas saying that the Program may 
        be  distributed under the terms of this FLOSS Exception. If you create 
        or  distribute a work which is a Derivative Work of both the Program and
        any other work licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is 
        not  available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS Exception 
        notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all respects,  
        including by retaining all GPL notices. You may choose to redistribute  a
        copy of the Program exclusively under the terms of the GPL by  removing
        the FLOSS Exception notice from that copy of the Program,  provided 
        that the copy has never been modified by you or any third  party.

      <p align="left"> The following is a a non-exhaustive list of

        licensing information for their users.  Compliance with one of the 
        licenses noted under the "FLOSS license  list" section remains a 
        prerequisite.
