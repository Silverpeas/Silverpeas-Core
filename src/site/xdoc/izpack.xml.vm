     <section name="Try Silverpeas easily">
      <p><img src="images/logos/logo_izPack.png" alt="izpack" style="padding-right:10px;float:left;position:relative;"/><br/>We provide an easy way to try Silverpeas using 
        <a href="http://izpack.org/">Izpack</a> with a pre-configured JBoss Server and an H2 Database.</p>
        <p>
        <b>You have to have a Java 6 JDK installed.</b><br/><b>This version is not suitable for production !</b>.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the 
          <a href="http://www.silverpeas.org/files/Silverpeas-${installer_stable_version}-installer.jar">installer</a> (~ 213 Mo)
        </li>
        <li>Run the following command (or double click on the jar file) 
          <code>java -jar Silverpeas-${installer_stable_version}-installer.jar</code>
        </li>
        <li>When all has been installed, go to the 
          <code>bin</code> directory under the installation directory and run the following scripts in that order 
          <ol>
            <li>start_db.bat (thus starting the database). <b>Don't close the console</b></li>
            <li>silverpeas_start_jboss.cmd (to start Silverpeas)</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Now you can open a browser to 
          <a href="http://localhost:8000/silverpeas">http://localhost:8000/silverpeas</a> an login using the account 
          <i>SilverAdmin/SilverAdmin</i>
        </li>
        <li>For 
          <b>Mac Users</b>, there seems to be a problem when trying Silverpeas offline, Mac OS X Lion doesn't resolve 
          <i>localhost</i>.  If you encounter this issue, use the following command:
          <source>sudo ifconfig en0 alias 127.0.0.1</source>.
        </li> 
      </ol>
