# maxFieldLength is a lucene property.
# Gives the maximum number of terms that will be indexed for a single field
# in a document. This limits the amount of memory required for indexing,

# will not crash the indexing process by running out of memory. 
# By default, no more than 10,000 terms will be indexed for a field.

# mergeFactor is a lucene property.
# Determines how often segment indexes are merged by addDocument().
# With smaller values, less RAM is used while indexing,
# and searches on unoptimized indexes are faster,
# but indexing speed is slower.
# With larger values more RAM is used while indexing
# and searches on unoptimized indexes are slower, but indexing is faster.
# Thus larger values (> 10) are best for batched index creation,
# and smaller values (< 10) for indexes that are interactively maintained. 
# This must never be less than 2. The default value is 10.

# maxMergeDocs is a lucene property.
# Determines the largest number of documents ever merged by addDocument().
# Small values (e.g., less than 10,000) are best for interactive indexing,

# Larger values are best for batched indexing and speedier searches.
