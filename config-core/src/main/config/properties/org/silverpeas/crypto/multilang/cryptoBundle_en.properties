crypto.cipherKeyImport=Import of cipher key
crypto.cipherKey=Cipher key:
crypto.importDescription=The cipher key expected here must be in hexadecimal and encoded in 256 bits.\nOnce the key is imported, the cipher of the encrypted content will be then renewed with this new key, this is can take a long time. During this operation, the encrypted content couldn't be accessed.
