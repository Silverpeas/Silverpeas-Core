/**
 * A REST-based Web service that handles the authentication of a user to the data server.
 * If the authentication matches the basic authentication scheme, then a session is opened in
 * Silverpeas for the user behind the request and that session can be used both for browsing
 * the Silverpeas web portal or to access the REST API by the same client. If the authentication
 * matches a bearer authentication scheme, then a session is created just for the HTTP request. The
 * latter is then pertinent only to check the authorization of the user to access the REST API of
 * Silverpeas.
 * <p>
 * This service is only interesting for opening an HTTP session before performing several tasks
 * in Silverpeas. It avoids to authenticate the user by its login and password for each HTTP request
 * against the REST API of Silverpeas. Nevertheless, the recommended (and better) way to consume the
 * REST API is to use the bearer authentication scheme with the API token of the user; the token
 * can be passed in each request against the REST API in the {@code Authorization} HTTP header
 * without passing through the heaver authentication mechanism by user credentials
 * (login/domain/password).
 * </p>
