 * qualified by a name that satisfies the following convention <code>[COMPONENT

 * this interface and the implementation has to be qualified with the @Named annotation by a name
 * satisfying the following convention <code>[COMPONENT NAME]FileUploadVerification</code>. For
 * example, for an application Kmelia, the implementation must be qualified with
 * <code>@Named("kmeliaInstanceFileUploadVerification") </code>
