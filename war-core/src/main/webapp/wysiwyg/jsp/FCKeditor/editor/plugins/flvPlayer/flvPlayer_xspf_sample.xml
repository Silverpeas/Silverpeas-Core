			<title>Aggressive Wallpaper</title>
			<creator>Jeroen Wijering</creator>
			<annotation>
				This is an aggressive wallpaper for public spaces where you don't want 
				people to linger around (eg. subway tunnels or parking lots). People 
				feel offended by the aggressive wallpaper and make sure they get out 
				of these places as soon as their business is done there.
