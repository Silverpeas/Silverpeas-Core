/**
 * Annotation to specify a navigation step creation/update on a HTTP method of a {@link
 * WebComponentController}.
 * <p/>
 * When a HTTP method with this annotation is called, one of the following internal treatment is
 * performed:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>if no navigation step is referenced by {@link #identifier()},
 *   then a navigation step is created and referenced with the specified annotation identifier</li>
 *   <li>if a navigation step with specified {@link #identifier()} already exists,
 *   then the navigation step stack is reset to this</li>
 * </ul>
 * Then, in any cases, the following internal treatments are performed:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link NavigationContext.NavigationStep#withFullUri(String)}: the current requested path
 *   URI (with URL parameters) is set</li>
 *   <li>{@link WebComponentController#specifyNavigationStep(WebComponentRequestContext,
 *   NavigationContext.NavigationStep, String)}: this method is called and according to given
 *   parameters the programmer can set additional informations to the navigation step (a
 *   functional label for example)</li>
