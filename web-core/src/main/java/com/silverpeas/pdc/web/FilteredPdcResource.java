   * Gets a PdC containing only the axis and the axis's value that were used in the classification
   * of the contents in Silverpeas. The Pdc can be restricted by the workspace and by the component
   * to which the classified contents belong. As the filtered PdC is for a search, only the
   * component instances configured as searchable are taken into account.
   *
   * The PdC that is sent back contains only the axis and, with each of them, the values to which
   * the contents in Silverpeas are classified. The classified contents to take into account can be
   * restricted by the workspace or by the application to which they belong, and by a set of axis'
   * values with which they have to be classified. The version of the returned PdC indicates, for
   * each axis's value, the count of contents that are classified with this value. According to the
   * query parameters, it can contain also the secondary axis of the PdC. The PdC is sent back in
   * JSON. If the user isn't authentified, a 401 HTTP code is returned. If a problem occurs when
   * processing the request, a 503 HTTP code is returned.
   *
   * @param workspaceId optionally the unique identifier of the workspace in which the classified
   * contents are published.
   * @param componentId optionally the unique identifier of the component to which the classified
   * contents belong.
   * @param withSecondaryAxis optionally a boolean flag indicating whether the secondary PdC axis
   * should be taken into account.
   * @param axisValues optionally a set of axis' values on which the contents to take into account
   * have to be classified. A value is defined by the identifier of the axis it belongs to and by
   * its path from the root value in this axis, the two fields separated by a ':' character.
   *
   * @return a web entity representing the PdC filtered by the contents that are classified on it.
   * The entity is serialized in JSON.
