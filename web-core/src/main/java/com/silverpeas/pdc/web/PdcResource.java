/**
 * A REST Web resource that represents the classification plan (named PdC) as configured for a given
 * Silverpeas component instance. The PdC is defined by a set of semantic axis that vehicule the
 * business concepts and the structures on which is based a given organization that uses the
 * Silverpeas collaborative portal. The values of an axis is thus made either of single terms (of
 * the inherent concept or structure) or of hierarchic semantic trees in which each branch carries
 * an exactness about the value of a concept. It exists two kinds of PdC: the model (or the
 * referent) in which all the axis to be used in the whole portail are defined, and the instances of
 * the model that are a PdC configured for a given Silverpeas component instance. The instances of
 * the model can be just a clone of the model or a modified version by taking only some of the
 * model's axis and by setting a diffent origin value (among the possible values of the axis) for
 * each chosen axis. Such PdCs are identified by an unique URI in which the identifier of the
 * Silverpeas component instance is referenced.
