/**
 * A REST Web resource that represents the classification plan (named PdC).
 *
 * The PdC is defined by a set of semantic axis that vehicule the business concepts and the
 * structures on which is based a given organization that uses the Silverpeas collaborative portal.
 * The values of an axis is thus made either of single terms (of the inherent concept or structure)
 * or of hierarchic semantic trees in which each branch carries an exactness about the value of a
 * concept. It exists two kinds of PdC: the model (or the referent) in which all the axis to be used
 * in the whole portail are defined, and the instances of the model that represent a PdC configured
 * for a given Silverpeas component instance. The instances of the model can be just a clone of the
 * model or a modified version by taking only some of the model's axis and by setting a diffent
 * origin value (among the possible values of the axis) for each chosen axis. Such PdCs are
 * identified by an unique URI in which the identifier of the Silverpeas component instance is
 * referenced.
