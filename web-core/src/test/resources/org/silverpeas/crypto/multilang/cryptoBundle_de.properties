crypto.cipherKeyImport=Import eines Chiffrierschl\u00fcssels
crypto.cipherKey=Chiffrierschl\u00fcssels:
crypto.importDescription=The cipher key must be in 256 bits in order to be used by the AES-256 algorithm to encrypt the data in Silverpeas. The value expected here must be in hexadecimal. Once the key is imported, the cipher of the encrypted content will be then renewed with this new key; during this operation the encrypted content could'nt be accessed by the users.
crypto.import=Importieren
crypto.importOk=The key import has succeeded and the cipher of the encrypted content has been renewed.
crypto.keyNotInHexadecimal=The key to import isn't in hexadecimal!
crypto.invalidKeySize=The size of the key doesn't satisfy the AES-256 requirements!
crypto.invalidKey=The format of the key is invalid: it must be in hexadecimal and in 256 bits.
crypto.keyUpdateFailure=The update of the cipher key has failed. Trace of the error:\\n{0}
crypto.cipherRenewFailure=The renew of the cipher of the content in Silverpeas has failed. Trace of the error:\\n{0}
